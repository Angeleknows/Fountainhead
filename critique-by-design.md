# Makeover Monday

**Graph selected for the redesign**: [Pew Research - Global Views on Homosexuality](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/06/25/global-divide-on-homosexuality-persists/pg_2020-06-25_global-views-homosexuality_0-01-png/)

**Original article**: [Pew Research - Global Divide on Homosexuality Persists](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/06/25/global-divide-on-homosexuality-persists/)

While reviewing various datasets, I chose to focus on "The Global Divide on Homosexuality Persists," published by the Pew Research Center, to gain a deeper understanding of the global context surrounding the acceptance of homosexuality. I decided to redesign this infographic to better highlight where social progress and acceptance toward homosexuality has changed, particularly in countries traditionally more conservative due to factors like politics. Around the world, “views on the acceptance of homosexuality in society remain sharply divided by country, region, and economic development” (Pew 2020). As an openly gay man, this issue is both personal and important to me. During a recent visit to South America, where queer identities are not always welcomed, I had to be cautious about disclosing one of my identities. However, it was interesting to see how this dataset included Argentina as more progressive in its social stance toward homosexuality as an accepted norm.

## The Critique

The Pew Research Center data visualization intended to represent global views on homosexuality suffers from several design issues that reduce its effectiveness. The crowded and chaotic layout, along with the use of green as a color, distracts from the map's central message. A more fitting color like lavender, historically associated with queer identity, would improve clarity and emotional resonance. The map's target audience, academics and policy experts, may find it effective for their statistical knowledge, but the lack of aesthetic appeal could hinder broader understanding.

Typography inconsistencies and spatial hierarchy problems, particularly with an overly zoomed-in Europe, create visual clutter. The numeric labels on countries are misaligned with the legend, further complicating interpretation. While a map is a good choice for this global topic, the design needs to focus more on key trends, such as the increasing acceptance of homosexuality in countries like South Africa, South Korea, and India, which the map fails to highlight effectively.

To improve the visualization, a simpler layout, better contrast, and more consistent typography are recommended. Shifting the focus from Europe to a more balanced global perspective, alongside using lavender to represent the queer community, would better support the research's argument and enhance the map's impact.

## Sketch Solutions

**Sketch 1**: ![sketch1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb680156-9252-47c9-bfc5-db57e1e66729)
I wanted to show the change in acceptance of homosexuality in society by using a bubble chart that would emphasize the proportion of change across 2013-2019 in countries that specifically had a double digit jump. I thought this particular metric was interesting to focus on since the original map didn't distinguish what the numbers meant, and it was hard to understand what all the colors and numeric values associated with them meant. 

**Sketch 2** ![sketch2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5af8e1f1-3848-4e7f-996a-2332b0b25c90)
I wanted to simplify the representation of change as much as possible by using a slope chart. What I liked about this concept was that it had a beginning point and an endpoint, which allowed me to focus on specificity instead of the entire data set for which the Pew Center conducted surveys.  I imagine only using lavender and white, or gay, so the chart was incredibly minimalistic. 

## Testing the Solution

**Healthcare Operations Analyst (Mid 30s)**:

**Can you tell me what you think this is?** "I think that this sketch is illustrating the momentum and evolution of how homosexuality has gained visibility."

**Can you describe to me what this is telling you?** "I think that it's showing a change in social acceptance around gays in society."

**Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?** "It's an unconventional approach to data visualization but it makes sense for capturing attention and emphasizing progression."

**Who do you think is the intended audience for this?** "This would likely appeal to a general audience, including those interested in data visualization, as well as those working in public health or social policy."

**Is there anything you would change or do differently?** "Using an animation could enhance the visualization significantly by making the progression more dynamic and visually engaging. If the focus is on illustrating movement,an animation would definitely add depth to the message."

**Grad Student (Early 30s)**:

**Can you tell me what you think this is?** "The sketch suggests using circle size to represent population percentages."

**Can you describe to me what this is telling you?** "It’s a direct, visual representation of the proportion of the population at different points in time. By adjusting the circle size, it allows for easy comparisons across years, emphasizing the magnitude of the change without the need for dynamic elements."

**Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?** "It’s clear and intuitive, but the focus on size over other variables could limit how much the viewer understands about other dimensions of the data, such as regional or demographic differences."

**Who do you think is the intended audience for this?** "This would likely be most effective for people who want a quick overview or a basic understanding of trends over time, like students, academics, or general viewers without deep statistical expertise. I guess it could appeal to many audiences if framed the right way."

**Is there anything you would change or do differently?** "While the circle size is an effective visual cue, it might be helpful to include additional context, like color coding or other annotations, to provide more depth and make the data even clearer, especially when comparing across years, yeah."

## Insights From User Feedback:

Both reviewers emphasize the importance of illustrating change over time, but they approach it from different angles. The health professional highlights the potential of animation to convey momentum and the emotional impact of progress, suggesting that seeing the data evolve would engage the audience more effectively. On the other hand, the grad student values simplicity and clarity, appreciating the use of circle sizes to represent percentages, as it allows for easy comparison across years without the complexity of dynamic elements.

From the feedback, I learned that the audience’s needs and expectations play a significant role in shaping the design approach. The health professional is focused on creating a more dynamic, immersive experience, while the grad student prefers something straightforward and intuitive. This highlights a tension between engaging the audience with a compelling, visually dynamic story versus providing clarity and ease of understanding with simpler visuals.

For my final redesign, I would focus on balancing these two perspectives. I think incorporating a more dynamic element, like subtle animations or transitions, could help bring the data to life and convey the momentum the health professional is advocating for. However, I’d retain the simplicity of the circle sizes as a primary visual cue, ensuring the message remains clear and easy to follow. Additionally, I’d consider adding more contextual elements, like color coding or annotations, to enhance understanding and provide deeper insights into the data. This way, the design would remain accessible while still engaging the audience with a richer, more dynamic experience.

## Final Vizualization



Ultimately I went with a stripped down map because the more I thought about it, a map was still the most intuitive approach to thinking about the topic. With the help  of descriptions that the user can hover over the six lavender-colored countries, I think that it's easy to understand that I am focusing only on countries where there is a double digit change in accepting homosexuality in society. Those small, but thoughtful changes ensure the audience’s attention is directed to the most impactful data from the Pew Research Center and demonstrate that even in politically conservative societies like Turkey and South Africa, views on homosexuality are gradually changing in society at large.
