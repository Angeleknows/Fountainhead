# Outline
Art has always been a passion of mine since I was a young boy, even though I’m not a practicing artist, *yet*. The way art captures identity, culture, and storytelling has always fascinated me as it allows us to imagine worlds beyond borders. As someone who has a deep appreciation for art’s ability to express the complexities of the human experience like migration, I want to explore how Latino artists, particularly those telling stories of immigrant identity, are supported through public policy and government funding.

In many countries outside of Latin America, Latino art is celebrated as a vital part of the cultural fabric. Take Spain, for example. The country has a long history of promoting Latin American and Latino cultural expressions, with dedicated funding programs for visual arts, muralism, and performing arts that highlight immigrant communities. Similarly, in places like Canada and even parts of Europe, there is a robust system of cultural grants and artist residencies that support the work of Latino artists, allowing them to share their stories in a way that can influence national discourse on identity and migration.

But in the United States, despite having one of the largest Latino populations outside of Latin America, the level of public support for Latino art often falls short. Unlike these other countries, where the arts are seen as a core part of the social dialogue, the funding and representation of Latino artists in the U.S. are often sidelined by political agendas and funding disparities.
This projecto will explore the impact of public policy on Latino art representation across seven major U.S. cities: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix, Philadelphia, and San Antonio. I will tell the story of how government funding influences the visibility and support for Latino art, with a particular focus on how these policies either promote or hinder the representation of immigrant identity, especially bicultural and bilingual experiences.

Given the current political climate surrounding Latino communities, where immigration and identity are central to ongoing debates, this question is more pressing than ever. By comparing these cities, I will highlight how funding for Latino art initiatives varies across the country, and what this means for cultural representation and the amplification of Latino voices in the public sphere.

# The Data

For this *projecto*, I’ve gathered data from several key sources that provide insight into Latino art funding and representation across U.S. cities. The 2023 NALAC Impact Report offers valuable data on the funding disparities faced by Latino artists and cultural organizations, providing a detailed view of how these organizations engage with their communities and the challenges they encounter due to funding gaps. I plan to use this data to highlight the differences in how Latino art initiatives are supported compared to other cultural sectors and demonstrate the funding challenges specific to Latino artists and communities. Additionally, I’m using data from the Latinx Funders - Funding Trends resource, which outlines how funders are addressing or failing to address the needs of Latino artists, and the Mellon Foundation’s $5M Initiative to advance Latinx art representation in museums. This initiative specifically highlights the efforts to bridge the gap in institutional support for Latino artists in cultural spaces like museums, which I plan to incorporate into the analysis of how public policy and funding decisions shape visibility and access to opportunities for Latino artists.

I will also integrate demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau to give context to the analysis, comparing Latino population sizes across the cities in question and correlating this with the funding data to explore whether there’s a proportional relationship between Latino population size and arts funding. Additionally, I will use open city data portals from cities like Los Angeles, New York, and San Antonio to gather information on how arts funding is allocated at the local level, particularly in public art and cultural outreach programs. This data will help contextualize the funding disparities and allow for a detailed comparison between cities, helping me to illustrate how public policy decisions at both the local and national levels influence the representation of Latino immigrant identities through art. By combining these data sources, I’ll be able to provide a clear, evidence-based argument for the need to prioritize equitable funding and representation of Latino artists in public art spaces.

# Method and Medium
> Shorthand is a great fit because it lets me tell a clear, engaging story with interactive visuals especially since my topic leans heavily towards the arts. This platform aligns with how I like to present data—seamlessly blending analysis with narrative, but ESRI's StoryMaps could also be a choice if maps are created.
> For the visuals, Python/MATLAB and Tableau give me the flexibility and precision I need to create custom, impactful charts. Python and Matlab let me dig deep into the data, while Tableau brings the interactivity that makes the insights more accessible
