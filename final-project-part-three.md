# Changes made since Part II

Since Part II, I’ve focused on making the narrative more cohesive by adding relative data to my audience to accentuate the need for more financial support in the arts for Latino artists. Based on feedback, I made a chart in DataWrarpper that reflects the quanity of funding that large philanthorpic groups like the Ford Foundation invest on Latino arts. I think that this graph ties the story together while keeping the tone focused on my target audience: large philantropist and cultural trust who are able to drive change in equitable representation in the arts, 

One major design change was refining my visualizations but they still fell light in part due to th challenge of finding data for arts funding in the cities I wanted to compare.

The call to action also got a major upgrade. Initially, it felt broad and abstract, but now it’s more actionable and tailored for philanthropic organizations. I included specific steps, like increasing funding for underrepresented institutions and partnering with cultural hubs like the Miami Museum of Contemporary Art of the Americas.

## The audience

My primary audience is philanthropic organizations like The Mellon Foundation, Ford Foundation, and Getty Foundation. These are the key players with the resources to address systemic funding disparities in Latino arts. To connect with them, I relied heavily on data-driven arguments and success stories that align with their goals of equity and cultural impact.

Personas and user feedback helped me refine my approach. I envisioned a foundation leader scrolling through the story and tailored the tone to resonate with someone who values actionable insights and measurable outcomes.

I also considered a secondary audience of cultural advocates and leaders who can amplify the message at a grassroots level. For them, I kept the language approachable and included broader takeaways that emphasize the importance of collective action.

## Final design decisions

This project has been a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience. It pushed me to think critically about how to tell a data-driven story in a way that feels human and impactful.

If I could revisit anything, I’d spend more time experimenting with additional visuals or interactive elements. But overall, I’m proud of how everything came together. The story feels polished, purposeful, and ready to inspire action.

I’m especially excited to include this project in my portfolio. It’s not just an assignment—it’s a meaningful piece of work that highlights an issue I care deeply about and has the potential to spark real change.

# Final thoughts
This project has been a deeply rewarding experience. I loved exploring the intersection of data, design, and advocacy, pushing myself to tell a story that is not only visually compelling but also meaningful. If I had more time, I’d refine the interactivity further, experimenting with scrollmation or embedded video elements to make the experience even more dynamic. I’d also dig deeper into mapping data to highlight regional funding disparities with greater precision. What I’m most proud of is how this project is a call for change that I hope inspires my audience to make a real impact.
