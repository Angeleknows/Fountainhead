# Latino Art, [UN]SEEN: Funding Gaps in Major US Cities
[Latino Art, [UN]SEEN: Funding Gaps in Major US Cities](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/latino-art-un-seen-funding-gaps-in-major-us-cities/index.html)


# Changes Made Since Part II

Since Part II, I’ve focused on making the narrative more cohesive by incorporating data that resonates with my audience, emphasizing the critical need for increased financial support in the arts for Latino artists. One key addition was a DataWrapper chart that highlights the quantity of funding major philanthropic organizations, such as the Ford Foundation, allocate to Latino arts. This visualization ties the story together and keeps the tone aligned with my target audience: large philanthropists and cultural trusts with the ability to drive equitable representation in the arts.

I also refined my visualizations, but they still felt somewhat limited due to the challenge of finding detailed arts funding data for the specific cities I wanted to compare. Despite this, the updates improved the narrative's clarity and focus.

The call to action underwent a significant transformation. Initially broad and abstract, it is now sharply focused and tailored for philanthropic organizations. I included actionable steps such as increasing funding for underrepresented institutions and fostering partnerships with cultural hubs like the Miami Museum of Contemporary Art of the Americas.



## The Audience

My primary audience is philanthropic organizations, including The Mellon Foundation, Ford Foundation, and Getty Foundation. These institutions are key players with the resources to address systemic funding inequities in Latino arts. To engage them effectively, I relied heavily on data-driven arguments and success stories that align with their overarching goals of equity and cultural impact.

Personas and user feedback played a crucial role in shaping my approach. I imagined a foundation leader scrolling through the story, looking for clear, actionable insights and measurable outcomes. This exercise helped me tailor the tone and content to meet their expectations.

Additionally, I considered a secondary audience of cultural advocates and leaders who can amplify this message at a grassroots level. For this group, I focused on maintaining an approachable tone and providing broader takeaways that emphasize collective action.


## Final Design Decisions

This project pushed me to think critically about presenting a data-driven story in a way that feels both human and impactful.

 The DataWrapper chart became a pivotal element, helping connect the dots for my audience. However, challenges with finding city-specific funding data limited the depth of some visualizations. I made deliberate choices to streamline the story, ensuring each section builds logically on the last. The result is a narrative that’s cohesive, engaging, and purpose-driven. If I could revisit anything, I’d experiment further with additional visuals or interactive elements to add dynamism to the story. Despite this, I’m proud of how everything came together and I think that it feels polished, purposeful, and ready to inspire action.

# Final Thoughts
This project has been a deeply rewarding experience. I loved exploring the intersection of data, design, and advocacy, pushing myself to tell a story that is not only visually compelling but also meaningful. If I had more time, I’d refine the interactivity further, experimenting with scrollmation or embedded video elements to make the experience even more dynamic. I’d also dig deeper into mapping data to highlight regional funding disparities with greater precision. The most frustrating part though for me was having a vision in mind of the story that I wnated to tell, but not finding enough data in the arts to coorroborate my argument. I found reports and even polished graphs representing changes in funding, but I did not use them as my own in my version III. I wish that some of the sources I relied on heavily, like, NALAC, gave access to raw data like the CSVs of the dashboard they created - without this, it was challenging to work on a niche topic that is facing serious underfunding, and ironically, the lack of data on this topic only further highlights why this topic is an issue in regards to cultural policy and the public arts. Despite these roadblocks, I’m most proud of is how this project is a call for change to the biggest philanthorpic organizations that have the meands to drive change, and I hope this narrative inspires my audience to make a real impact and support artists from my cultural background because our voices help add more color to the fabric of America.
