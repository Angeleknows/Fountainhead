# Shorthand Story
 [Latino Art, Unseen Funding Gaps in Major US Cities](https://preview.shorthand.com/wgYqYv4o6uS280Ao)


# User research 

## Target audience
> My primary target audience includes cultural arts trusts that manage and distribute government and private funds, as well as representatives from local arts organizations and key benefactors who influence funding decisions for public art initiatives. These individuals have the authority to champion equitable investments in Latino art, ensuring it has a meaningful presence in public spaces and cultural institutions.
> At the same time, a broader audience, including community members and arts enthusiasts, plays an important role in building momentum and supporting these changes. Engaging this wider group can amplify calls for equity in the arts and create pressure for actionable change. I designed my Shorthand story to resonate with both audiences, providing clear evidence and a narrative that inspires action while remaining approachable and visually compelling.
> To inform my approach, I dug into funding reports from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), city governments, the National Association of Latino Arts and Cultures (NALAC), and press releases from donors like the Mellon Foundation. This research helped me pinpoint who holds the decision-making power and how their priorities shape opportunities for Latino artists. My goal is to move these stakeholders to act while also fostering broader support for representation in the arts.

## Interview Findings: 
>The interviews showed that the story communicates the underfunding of Latino artists clearly and effectively, using comparisons like Los Angeles to engage the audience. Visualizations were strong, with transitions and color choices standing out, but there’s room to add more data and annotations to better highlight disparities. Feedback pointed to the need for more context, including structural reasons behind inequities and personal stories to make the narrative more impactful. The interviewees corroborated that the target audience should be public funding officials, private arts funders, and leaders in arts organizations who have the influence to prioritize equitable funding. The call to action was seen as clear, urging these stakeholders to address the funding disparities for Latino artists by increasing investments and adopting policies that reflect the equity seen in cities like Los Angeles.

|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What story do you think the data is telling?                | There’s an underfunding of Latino artists across major U.S. cities.         | There’s a large gap in funding for Latino art compared to other categories of public art. | Latino artists face systemic inequities in accessing arts funding. |
| Did the story capture your attention, and was it easy to follow? | Yes, clear structure using Los Angeles as a benchmark for comparison.       | The story was clear but could benefit from more global context for non-U.S. audiences.   | Very engaging, especially with the comparisons across cities.     |
| How effective were the visualizations in supporting the story? | Worked: Transitions between light and dark themes. Didn’t work: Missing data comparing overall arts funding to Latino art funding. | Worked: Simple and clean graphs. Didn’t work: Lack of annotation on the key disparities. | Worked: Color choices were vibrant. Didn’t work: Felt some graphs had too much text. |
| Were there any parts of the story or visuals that felt incomplete or could be improved? | Suggests adding data showing disparities between total arts funding and Latino art funding. | Add insights into why these funding gaps exist—are there structural or historical reasons? | Consider showing personal stories of Latino artists to complement the data. |
| Who do you think the target audience is for this story?      | Public funding officials and private arts funders.                          | Policymakers and advocates in arts funding, especially those in the U.S. | Arts organizations and community leaders passionate about equity. |
| Were the main takeaways and recommendations clear?          | Yes, clear call to action: Increase funding for Latino art in other cities to match Los Angeles. | Somewhat clear but could benefit from specifying actionable steps for funders. | Very clear and persuasive, especially for those already engaged in the arts. |

# Identified changes for Part III
> I plan to refine my story by incorporating additional data points, specifically by playing around with different graphs in Python/Matlab, providing more context on systemic barriers to equitable funding, and strengthening the call to action with specific, actionable steps for stakeholders. I will also enhance my visualizations with annotations to better highlight disparities and consider adding personal stories of Latino artists to create a more compelling narrative.

| **Research synthesis**                  | **Anticipated changes for Part III**                                            |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The story clearly communicates underfunding of Latino artists but could use more supporting data. | Add data comparing total arts funding to the proportion allocated to Latino art in various cities. |
| Visualizations were engaging but lacked key annotations and some clarity in explaining disparities. | Include annotations in graphs to highlight funding gaps more explicitly, and simplify graphs with too much text. |
| The narrative could benefit from personal stories to deepen emotional engagement. | Integrate at least one example of a Latino artist impacted by funding inequities to humanize the data. |
| The call to action is clear but could include more actionable steps.             | Specify policies or funding practices that stakeholders can adopt to address inequities. |
| A global context might help appeal to international audiences.                  | Briefly include parallels or examples from other countries where equitable arts funding has been successful. |

# Final Thoughts
>It’s been incredibly insightful to see how different perspectives, including my own, shaped my understanding of what works and what doesn’t in the story. Feedback like adding personal stories or refining visualizations has helped me see the potential to make the narrative more impactful and engaging. It’s been satisfying to realize how small changes can make a big difference in how the story is received.
>The challenges, however, have been significant. One of the toughest parts has been deciding what data to work with and finding a clear focus for the story. In Part 1, I had too much data to work with and I began to feel overwhelmed like I had to scrape through each data set to find the important points I needed to support my analysis. At times, I felt pulled in multiple directions, and wasn't sure if I had the clearest narrative going on - ultimately, I decided to focus on just comparing cities and layering on how their Latino population differs to the percent of funding for latino artits in those cities. Balancing authenticity of data along with telling a clear story that is personally importatn to me has been difficult, but it’s also been a necessary learning experience. I’ve come to understand that refining the focus is as much about what to leave out as it is about what to include. In the end, I’m confident that this process will result in a stronger, more cohesive final version.
