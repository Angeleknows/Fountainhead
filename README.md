# TSWD-portfolio-templates
Portfolio templates for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages as you like for your own portfolio!  
Sometimes it's helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference:

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi! Coucou! ¡Hola!  My name is Eder Hernández and I'm a second year master's candidate at Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University studying Public Policy & Management. I'm originally from Santa Barbara, CA but have called Los Angeles, CA home since my early 20s. I love the outdoors, including hiking along the coast and finding new cute coffee shops. 

In my former career, I worked in data governance from a legal perspective, specializing in health. I love the idea of continuing in this work, but from a more creative and global lens.

A personal idol of mine in the dataviz field is the late Hans Rosling, who was a Swedish physicist and an impressiver orator that was able to engage with data in the most captivating, and interactive fashion that I have ever witnessed. Check out this excerpt of his from the BBC.

I am excited to embark on this new journey as a designer & data scientist to have a positive impact on society!

# What I hope to learn

1. I aim to become more comfortable transforming data into impactful presentations that draw compelling insights.
2. Enhance my ability to collaborate with peers whose skills complement mine. While I feel confident as a designer, I seek support in the data science realm.
3. To find joy in imperfections of data, and have that nuance guide me as my North Star in my second career in public interest technology and entrepreneurship. Poetic justice through data...

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
