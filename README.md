# About me
¡Hola!  My name is Eder Hernández and I'm a second year master's candidate at Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University studying Public Policy & Management. I'm originally from Santa Barbara, CA but have called Los Angeles, CA home since my early 20s. I love the outdoors, including hiking (along the coast) and finding new cute coffee shops. 

In my former career, I worked in data governance from a legal perspective, specializing in health. I love the idea of continuing in this work, but from a more creative and global lens.

A personal idol of mine in the dataviz field is the late Hans Rosling, who was a Swedish physicist, statistician, and an impressiver orator. He was gifted in explaning data in the most captivating, and interactive fashion that I have ever witnessed. Check out this excerpt of his from the BBC.

I am excited to embark on this new journey as a designer & data scientist to have a positive impact on society!

# What I hope to learn

1. I aim to become more comfortable transforming data into impactful presentations that draw compelling insights.
2. Enhance my ability to collaborate with peers whose skills complement mine. While I feel confident as a designer, I seek support in the data science realm.
3. To find joy in imperfections of data, and have that nuance guide me as my North Star in my second career in public interest technology and entrepreneurship. Poetic justice through data...

This visualization takes a look at five countries where the median government debt hit 90% or greater from 1999 to 2019. Over this decade, it’s evident that countries starting off with a sizable amount of debt kept piling on more. However, I realize this narrative can be a bit misleading since I didn’t fully account for the shifts in some countries’ values. For instance, Poland started off in 2009 with a median of 50.4%, yet its debt as a percentage of GDP steadily climbed, eventually landing it in the same ballpark as the other countries I focused on based on debt growth.

I zeroed in on Greece, the USA, Italy, Japan, and Canada because Tableau flagged them as outliers but I wasn't sure why. After closer inspection, what stood out to me was how these countries all experienced a notable bump in debt over the decade. I also overlooked Portugal when discussing increasing debt over time since it didn’t start with a median of at least 90% (beginning in the 70s), but its debt load still surged. Looking back, I think I could have done a better job visualizing this. Still, I’m pretty happy with how my dataviz highlights the outliers, using bright pops of color against a muted gray palette for the rest of the dataset. It really draws the eye to those key players and tells the story that certain countries with already high median debt levels just kept racking up more debt.

I personally prefer this representation over a two-toned heat map because it grabs the audience's attention and really communicates the narrative I want to convey. I leaned into using gray as a friend while letting color accentuate what I wanted to show. I initially tried bubble charts, but ultimately found their sizes, without any axes, to be out of context and challenging to interpret. So, I went with a Pointillism-inspired approach that’s visually striking due to the hierarchy I implemented by organizing the countries alphabetically. This worked in my favor, ensuring there was aesthetic balance in the frame. One tweak I would’ve loved to make, but didn’t know how, was to change the font color of the countries whose data is muted. Compared to the OECD bar chart, my dataviz emphasizes outliers through color and texture, and it’s rendered much cleaner than the heat map, which feels busy with distracting numeric values across the landscape.
