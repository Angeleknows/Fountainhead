This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
¡Hola!  My name is Eder Hernández and I'm a second year master's candidate at Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University studying Public Policy & Management. I'm originally from Santa Barbara, CA but have called Los Angeles, CA home since my early 20s. I love the outdoors, including hiking along the coast and finding new cute coffee shops. 

In my former career, I worked in data governance from a legal perspective, specializing in health. I love the idea of continuing in this work, but from a more creative and global lens.

A personal idol of mine in the dataviz field is the late Hans Rosling, who was a Swedish physicist and an impressiver orator that was able to engage with data in the most captivating, and interactive fashion that I have ever witnessed. Check out this excerpt of his from the BBC.

I am excited to embark on this new journey as a designer & data scientist to have a positive impact on society!

# What I hope to learn

1. I aim to become more comfortable transforming data into impactful presentations that draw compelling insights.
2. Enhance my ability to collaborate with peers whose skills complement mine. While I feel confident as a designer, I seek support in the data science realm.
3. To find joy in imperfections of data, and have that nuance guide me as my North Star in my second career in public interest technology and entrepreneurship. Poetic justice through data...
